# digital-circuits

### My personal projects during the Digital Circuits course in the Computer Engineering program at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.


On this grade we see some basics logic circuits and learn to describe them using Verilog, that is a HDL (Hardware Description Language).
The Final Project is to made a 8-bit processor.

We also use an online simulator created by [InPlace](https://www.inplace-da.com/) called Pitanga, wich is a virtual fpga board. The .pinout files are for configurate the Pitanga board I/O.
